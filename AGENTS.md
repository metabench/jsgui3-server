# Agent Guidelines

- Use `snake_case` for variables, functions, and helper utilities introduced by agents.
- Use `Snake_Case` (PascalCase) for classes and constructors.
- Update existing agent-authored code to match these conventions when you make changes.
- If you must diverge from this convention, document the reason directly in the relevant file.
