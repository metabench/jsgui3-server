# Agent Guidelines

- Use `snake_case` for variables, functions, and helper utilities introduced by agents.
- Use `Snake_Case` (PascalCase) for classes and constructors.
- Update existing agent-authored code to match these conventions when you make changes.
- If you must diverge from this convention, document the reason directly in the relevant file.

## Reference Guide

The [GUIDE_TO_AGENTIC_WORKFLOWS_BY_GROK.md](docs/GUIDE_TO_AGENTIC_WORKFLOWS_BY_GROK.md) provides comprehensive principles for autonomous AI task execution. It covers foundational concepts, context gathering, planning strategies, execution patterns, tool integration, quality assurance, communication, error handling, and advanced techniques for complex multi-phase projects. This guide is useful for agents to master agentic workflows, ensuring systematic, goal-directed processes for independent task completion, with emphasis on responsibility, continuous learning, and quality gates.
