# Jsgui3 Server

This module covers functionality that enables the application to be served to clients.

2022: Seems as though the server could be bundled with a few useful / essential compilers.

// Just running the Server without a website set up could be a way to test the compilers and data transformers.
// Would then be able to publish access to the compilers using the server mechanisms.
