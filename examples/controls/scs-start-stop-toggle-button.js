//  Include jsgui client js as default.
//  Would maybe want to substitute that with a different client build that includes jsgui3 (client) and custom controls and logic.

// A very simple one.
//  Could abstract it to a function call.

// Give it a live Control?
//  Would want to give that Control access to a server-side resource too.
