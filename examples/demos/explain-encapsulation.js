// Will have a page with text about my thoughs on encapsulation and how functionality is better encapsulated in mixind, rather than controls.
//  How to do it
//  Best practises.
//   as in the mixin adds the functionality. not necessarily runs it. functionality may apply to controls, ready to be used.
//   differentiate between setup and usage of the mixin functionality.
