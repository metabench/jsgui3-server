/*
    Would be nice to have the whole client and server within this single file.
    Want this to demonstrate simple usage of features to create the controls and server.

    // Possibly this will need more compilation to extract the client-side part from it.
    //  Compilation of a single server file to extract the client does seem like it would be very useful.
    //  Will be nice to have single file examples.
    //  Isomorphism will be created by separating out the client and the server js (and css too of course).

    // js_resource.client_and_server_js_from_server_js
    //  so it also filters out any client-only code from the js.

    // Would make a lot of sense not to have to write a jsgui client and server app with more than one js file.

    // However, this seems like it would be a fair bit more work to get done.
    //  The single control server example currently work because they serve controls that already exist.

    // A Demo_Frame control or just Demo control would help frame things too.

    // Square box will be simpler to start with at least...

// Define the single control
// Define the server
