// A simple demo to show sending data from the server to the client. Just the time. Will get updated quite frequently. Maybe a stream.
//  A different demo for websockets demo. Will need more work on that system too.
//   Maybe write some / all / most of it outside of jsgui3. Can then incorporate that / those modules into jsgui 3 or 4.
