// Want to give it the js to include?
//  Include jsgui client js as default.
//  Would maybe want to substitute that with a different client build that includes jsgui3 (client) and custom controls and logic.

// Give it a live Control?
//  Would want to give that Control access to a server-side resource too.


// We should be able to give that single control params too.

// Body_Server

// Provides page bodies that go along with routes.
//  Need to be able to activate clients too.

// A pluggable activation function?

		// Seems like too many items were added to the map.
		//  Must be created accidently on start.

		// Seems like the control gets constructed twice, or registered with s different id.#
		//  At least the mainscs control.
		// Could do with some control querying / searching capabilities.

		// control selectors
		// may want to search for all controls that match a particular set of points.
