// Now it's the very basics of a website publisher. Quite flexible but could do with more.
//  Better integration with bundler
//  Rendering webpages that are dynamic and therefore not bundled (eg user specific content).
//   Though the js could be bundled. Maybe some of the controls could be bundled? Or semi-bundled?

// HTTP_Webpage_Publisher could be interesting.
//  The Website Publisher could make use of some of its functionality.


// Handling HTTP / bundling for a specific page could be cool.

// A Webpage Publisher may be simpler and better to work on in the short term.
//  Maybe would not need to be (as) concerned with routing.
//  Could be useful for publishing a SPA of course, kind of a website but as a single page.

// This seems more like the server router these days
//  The main server router seems to pass everything to this - maybe that will change.

// Maybe give it some kind of Website_Server????

// Have the Website_Server use the Website_Publisher????

// Need to somewhat separate concerns.

// Publisher here could be simple in terms of bundling, and then giving the paths to the router.
//   And could have really simple code implementation of doing just that.

// This basically can be simple....
//   But make the classes' structures more complicated where necessary to accommodate.


// Could be just a few lines of logic probably, at least the simplest core implementation.

// Think the server or the website already has a router, so have the website resource's router do the routing.
//   Maybe upgrade the routers to handle premade (compressed) responses.

// Maybe better to bundle and publish resources.
// resource-processors in its own dir?
//   as in it's not actually part of resources?




// Need to basically make this do very little.

// Publish (website, server_router)


// Or publish it only under some URLs / domains....?






// Probably is worth by default having it use the HTTP_Website_Publisher with really simple server setups.


// Extend HTTP_Web_Item_Publisher   HTTP_Web_Page_Or_Site_Publisher  (synonym) ????

// Share functionality between webpage and website where useful.
