Function publishing, and some other sorts of publishing, should maybe be contained in another module / set of modules.
May need to work without all the HTML and Control things for some applications.

Will have more of an abundance of mid-level HTTP publishing code.

Want to avoid getting bogged down in this when publishing / serving a simple site or page.
Though this can be used, it could operate with default configurations, and provide functionality that gets used as needed during the process.
