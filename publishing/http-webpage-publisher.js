// HTTP_Webpage_Publisher could be interesting.
//  The Website Publisher could make use of some of its functionality.

// Handling HTTP / bundling for a specific page could be cool.

// A Webpage Publisher may be simpler and better to work on in the short term.
//  Maybe would not need to be (as) concerned with routing.
//  Could be useful for publishing a SPA of course, kind of a website but as a single page.

// Should have more concerning bundling / compilation.


// There could be 'bundle' functionality for the webpage.

// The webpage itself could know what client js it needs to use.

// Seems like bundling a specified webpage earlier on in the process makes sense.

// And a Bundler as well?
//  Perhaps HTTP_Webpage_Bundler would be an important class to have here.
//   Considering how it could be interchangable from the publisher if it's a different class.

// Possibly a Publisher should be called to provide something over HTTP.
//  So the call is routed to a Webpage object, through the Publisher.
//  Publisher could maintain a cache.
//   Maybe the publisher should read the bundle?
//   Maybe the publisher should do the bundling?
//    Perhaps there should be a bit more coordination of the bundling process, possibly accessed once needed.
//
