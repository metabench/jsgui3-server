Resources are a way to wrap a thing / process
For the moment some have handle_http functions

Resources will be more about encapsulation of functionality
So a resource is a mostly known quality of programmatic unit.

Resources may be wrapped / published in other things.

The Resource class / subclass itself contains and represents some other
piece of functionality in most cases.

More general purpose, or otherwise specific, non-Resource code
can then be wrapped in a Resource. In many cases the code in the Resource
class wraps some other code that does something specific.
