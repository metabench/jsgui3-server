// Or will use some different 'Bundler' classes for the moment.
// Bundlers will extract CSS from JS too.

// Will make use of features already in jsgui to handle / do compilation.


// Want compilation to be handled lower level within the jsgui system.
//  jsgui.compile(code, compilation_options);

// jsgui compiler toolkit could go in lang-tools or even lang-mini.
//  there is also the jsx compiler, should be similar to call to Babel.


// Handling rust => wasm compilation will be nice too.
// And other languages that compile to WASM, such as C and C++.

// Much of it will require HD space.
//  Want to wrap that in a convenient interface that could be upgraded to RAM drive,
//   network RAM drive etc.

// May need to install / verify installation of necessary compilers, eg cargo, gcc.

// And specific compilation / compiler resources?
//  As resources, the management of their access will be controlled (maybe made available remotely) programatically.

// Want babel, esbuild
// Also rust.
// Rust to integrated WASM would be very nice.
//  Being able to write rust files that seamlessly connect with JS files.
//   Or even integrating Rust code within a js file....
//    or xjs?
