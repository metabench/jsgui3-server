// Could make a more specific feature extraction part.

// 2.1 Identify
// 2.2 ??? - Extract_Feature?

// Will identify more information about what JS is contained.
//  Eg if it's a recognised code library structure that can be extracted.
//   Identify the main block of declarations in a (library or framework) file.
//    Identify the variable definitions in there.

// Need more capability here to find and match specified features.

// Asking questions about a piece of code - questions to later determine what it is and how to use it.

// May have a .query object.
//  Somewhat drastic change
//   and .query will be used through its properties

// .query.child.declaration.child.declarator.name
// .query.child.declaration.child.declarator.name
// const q = node.query.child.declaration.child.declarator.name

// exequery(q)
// q.exe

// q.exe function makes sense for the query.

// can do qres = node.query.child.declaration.child.declarator.name.exe();
// qures = node.exeq(node.query.child.declaration.child.declarator.name);

// That means cutting down on the amount of potential changes to the non .query querying functionality.
//  May well be worth keeping them for the moment, until / unless completelty superceded by the query api - apart from perhaps in convenience of the functions themselves.
//   Then they could be expressed in one line declarations that show the shorthands available for the really nice query operations.






// Maybe this is 'Explore' rather than 'Query'. Or 'Navigate'.
//  Providing the relationships will be useful in some cases for the queries and running them.

// The query objects themselves, will be driven by properties.
//  query obj
//   property called. creates a query object that is given an array of previous / suffix query words.
//  Then when the query is built, it gets executed.
//   Maybe the query execution part will need to be quite substantial.
//    Probably best to do a stage 1 check / plan of the query, to make sure that it makes sense.
//     There could be a multitude of inner type functions, such as filtering and finding things - but it will need to either be recursive, or logically progress correctly processing
//      the query.

// User-friendly query objects are definitely the way forward.
//  For the moment though, can do more with some simpler (query?) methods such as node.filter.child 

// The .query system will be the best way by far to both create and run some more complex queries in a syntax that closely resembles the English language.

// These are more like core extended???
//  these are functions / getters / iterators
