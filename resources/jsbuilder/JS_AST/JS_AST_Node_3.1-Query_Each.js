// Operation_On_Relationship

// Could make a more specific feature extraction part.
//  Will come up with more:

// 2.1 Identify
// 2.2 ??? - Extract_Feature?

// Will identify more information about what JS is contained.
//  Eg if it's a recognised code library structure that can be extracted.
//   Identify the main block of declarations in a (library or framework) file.
//    Identify the variable definitions in there.

// Need more capability here to find and match specified features.

// Asking questions about a piece of code - questions to later determine what it is and how to use it.

// .matches_type_signature(signature)

// . but using a tree is better for checking multiple signatures at once.

// basically 'deep iterate', though could apply to .child or .ancestor
