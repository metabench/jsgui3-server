// 2.1 Identify
// 2.2 ??? - Extract_Feature?

// Will identify more information about what JS is contained.
//  Eg if it's a recognised code library structure that can be extracted.
//   Identify the main block of declarations in a (library or framework) file.
//    Identify the variable definitions in there.

// Need more capability here to find and match specified features.
// Asking questions about a piece of code - questions to later determine what it is and how to use it.
// .matches_type_signature(signature)
// . but using a tree is better for checking multiple signatures at once.
