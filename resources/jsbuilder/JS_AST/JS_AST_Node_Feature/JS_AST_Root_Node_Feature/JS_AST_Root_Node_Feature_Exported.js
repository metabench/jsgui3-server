// Exported keys is an important thing to be on the lookout for.
//  However, trying to get it working shows some need for improved querying, as well as going into more detail on Object objects.
//  Could make a .keys feature on those in particular.
//  Indexing will help to find the referred to objects quickly.
//  Queries would enable quick finding with a nice API too.
