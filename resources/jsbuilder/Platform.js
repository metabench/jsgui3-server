        // Within that will be defined quite a lot of objects.
        //  With some of them, we will trace back the references to their declarations, and also have those declarations within the application in a way which
        //  allows them to be used within a platform.

        // Will allow both bottom-up building of a platform and project, and top-down loading and building.


        // Can load files in any order, but can also load the main file, and have it automatically load all relevant files.












        // Adding files and functions to platforms.
        //  will be nice to create actual files using referenced code.

        //  Could generate code from the tree I have.
        //   Not sure of the importance, Babel code gen is probably fine.








        // Functionality concerning bringing code into the platform.

        // Automated import of a full file makes sense.
        //  Later consider removing unused parts of platforms?

        // Events raised during import would be useful for logging at least.

        // Will be nice to make a tiny subset of lang-mini to start with.
        //  And also to see what subset of it gets used in a larger build, and see what can be ignored during the compilation.

        // Index of occurrances of all variable names.
        //  More concerned with names imported and exported.

        // Index of everything imported and imported...
        //  Possibly that will be 'project'.


        // Variable naming / renaming within a platform?
        //  Could be done within a file.

        // Add a specific function from a specific file.

        // Platform creation, and output from the platform makes sense.

        //  Need a Platform to handle multiple js closures.

        // Try an array of declarations in the platform. Or DeclarationSequence really.
