// Build jsgui-client as a platform.
//  Have a map of the variables provided (a long list), and the names have been remapped, meaning that inside the platform's internal closure (a function call), these variables are available outside
//   or could even be given in a tidy, user friendly way that keeps to the right API.

// Want to expose jsgui3-client in a way that than makes it easy to code for, even directly without further building.

// Another important feature will be to build jsgui3-client there as a requirement for the client-side js for an app.
//  Will be good / great to get really small file sizes.

//  A working build will be a nice thing too of course.
