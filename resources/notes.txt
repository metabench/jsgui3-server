from jsgui3-html

jsgui.Resource = require('./resource/resource');
jsgui.Resource_Pool = require('./resource/pool');
jsgui.Resource.Data_KV = require('./resource/data-kv-resource');
jsgui.Resource.Data_Transform = require('./resource/data-transform-resource');


Want a really simple search & replace type template system for the moment.

Integrating react into the server at various levels would help.
