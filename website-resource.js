// Want to get the core resources working and tested.
//  Want to run a clock website / service to start with.
//  The server could have a clock, while clients could connect to it and share the information.
//  Could also experiment with P2P distribution of the data.
//  A clock is also useful because it contains time signals so we can see how long it takes for data to reach various machines.


// A web resource in particular?
// Any need for an HTML resource?
//  Probably not - have web resource handle HTML and websockets.


// Resources could also have events which objects can listen to.
//  Programmatic objects can listen.
//  The resources may broadcast to whatever is listening.

// Also, maintaining one connection stream, communicating with multiple resources - could connect through a Resource Pool, or maybe there
//  could be a Multi Resource Publisher that publishes a bunch of resources.

// The Application router at the moment sending requests to resources.
//  I am thinking that rather than doing that, the requests should be handled by a resource publisher that interacts with the resource and publishes it over HTTP.

// Resources in general won't handle HTTP requests, though they will have the capability.
//  More likely that a resource, when it is served online, will be served using a Resource Publisher (which is itself a resource), which handles HTTP implementation details that would otherwise have
//  to be repeated between resources.




//define(["./jsgui-lang-util", './abstract-resource'], function(jsgui, AR) {

// Do this not with AMD?



// May need Website_Data_Resource
//  Would be configured within the node app, client has maximum autoconfig from connecting to the server, and integration with client-side controls.
//  With the DB admin, it's about returining queries (maybe from RAM) about table data.
//  /data/then the api?

// Respond to both data HTTP requests and websocket connections.



// HTTP data request -> response seems like the most important step now.



// An fs Resource would be of use for file system browser.
//  Could have a client-side fs resource that connects to a veriety of services, could have one that connects to the server-side fs resource.

// Need to connect a data-providing resource to the UI component in cases where it's not secure to do so automatically.
//  It would be much more secure to bring up an NTP provision service automatically than a file system one. Don't want to take that risk now.
